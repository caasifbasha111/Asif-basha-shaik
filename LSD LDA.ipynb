It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S.

I drink coffee every day and have tried many different types. I've never tried low acid coffee before so was not sure what to expect.  In my opinion, this was very good.  It has a rich, dark roasted \"starbuck-like\" taste.  I recommend trying it.\n",
       "23089    I normally don't choose darker roasts of coffee because I don't like the acid and bitter flavor that is normally associated with them.  This coffee is quite different from a standard dark roast.  It has the smoother flavor of a lighter roast without the acid.<br /><br />I prepare my coffee in a french press with water at a temperature just below boiling, around 175 degrees fahrenheit.  When I poured in the water, I could smell a sort of a burnt aroma as well as a distinctly licorice aroma.  Undaunted, I finished my preparations and added some creamer and a touch of sweetener.  Upon tasting, I detected notes of chocolate and toasted nuts with a slight licorice finish.  Very smooth.  No bitterness or acid.  The burnt aroma didn't go into the flavor.  It just tasted toasty.<br /><br />It was a nice change-up from my usual coffee.  I usually choose light to medium roasts.  I would like to try some of their other offerings.\n",

It is a delicious coffee, earthy and has a very good flavor. The only other alternative is the New Orleans style coffee with chicory which some people either love or hate, but it also is less acidic.<br /><br />So enjoy your coffee and forget about heartburn problems.\n",

I normally brew dunkin donuts brand coffees at home and really enjoy their flavor.  There are a few other brands that I will buy when they are available in this town, though that is rarely.<br /><br />I did not care for the flavor of this coffee.  It was very wooden tasting and almost had an old burnt coffee flavor to it.

And no stomach upset either.<br /><br />The taste is good, no after taste of bitterness, smooth and dark the way I like it.<br /><br />I made a potful and asked everyone else for their opinions and everyone said, \"It tastes good, pretty much like any other coffee.\"\n",

Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!\n",

And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.

      "Post before vectorization: My two boys LOVE the semi-moist Pet Greens treats. Admittedly, Biscuit is not overly choosey, but Chicken has turned up his nose at the other treats I've tried. Now, if I say \"treat\" or even reach toward where I keep them, Chicken comes running. They DO smell weird -- kind of like not-so-freshly mowed grass, but the odor quickly dissipates and the kitties love 'em. So far we've tried the chicken (ironically enough) and the salmon and both have been equally well-received.\n",
